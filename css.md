#  CSS usage

All styling is done using CSS which can be modified although that may mean that the SVG
looks strange. As an example I modified the stroke width of a plot but inadvertently
changed the stroke width of the related text.

Each plot has a class, either set using the [`cssClasses`](json.md#cssClasses) tag or assigned as `plot01` etc.
